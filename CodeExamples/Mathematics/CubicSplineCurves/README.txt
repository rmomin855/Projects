How To Use:
1) only the area encapsulated by the grey lines is useful, any points outside are culled.
2) to create a control point simply 'left-click' anywhere within the grey lines.
3) if you wish to move points, click on the appropriate red circle;
when trying to move points please move them slowly, if you try to move them quickly you will lose hold and a new point will be created instead.
